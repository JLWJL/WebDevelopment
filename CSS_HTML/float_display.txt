Example: navigation using list

block level elements can set width, height, padding, background and so on.
inline level elements don't have text-align,height,width and so on.

<li>: block level
<a>: inline level


**SET 1***
li{
	display:inline;
	// no width, height for <li>, the width could be presented as the content
	//within it, for example, <a> (must set <a> as display:inline-block)
	
	/*text-align:center; //doesn't work if <li> is set as 'inline'
						//and if <a> is 'inline-block' at the same time, it
						//will set the <a> block centered, instead of the text
						// in <a>*/
	/*background-color: blue; //don't do this, as bg color will only display under the text. Declare it in <a>*/
}

a{
	display:inline-block;
	text-align: center;
	width:20%;	//	width is 20% of <ul>, instead of <li>, as <li> is set as 'inline'
	/*height: 20px;	//don't do this, height adjust to text size automatically*/
	line-height:3;	/*control the height of <a>, if it is too small, the bg color will NOT fill the outline/border if there is one
					if not set, bg color fill out the container*/
	color:red;
	background-color:green;	//

}


**SET 2***
li{
	float:left;  /*<li> is still of block level.*/
	width: 20%; /*if no 'width' defined, the width will adjust according to the content in it, e.g. <a>aaa</a>, <a>bbbbbbbbb</a>*/
	text-align:center; /*this will make content of <a> centered in <li>*/

	/*color:red; don't define this if the words are within between <a>*/

	
}

a{

	color: red; /*must define here if you want to change color of the text within <a>*/
	font-size:20px;

	/*display:inline-block;	//only when this declared, <a> 'box' will be positioned by "text-align" in <							li>
							//and the below will make sense;
	background-color: red;	//without 'inline-block' and 'width', the area of bg color adjusts to the 								content.
	text-align:center;	//set words in the middle of <a>, without 'inline-block', this doesn't work
	width:30%;	// 30% of <li> width; doesn't work without 'inline-block'

	For easy layout and color effect, don't set 'inline-block' for <a> when using 'float' for <li>
	*/
}

when <li> is 'inline', set <a> as 'inline-block' so that <a> can have effects of width, text center-aligned and so on

when <li> is 'inline-block', normally keep <a> 'inline' as default


Floated elements is taken out of the normal flow of page, thus:
If container only contains 'floated' elements, this container will collapse over the 'floated' elements being unvisibal, 
unless you put some content and give a background color over there.
If you want containers background color to expand to cover the 'floated' elements, do 'clear:both' with an empty <div>
after 'floated' elements WITHIN the container before closing
