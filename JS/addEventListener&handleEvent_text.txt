1. Definition:

addEventListener(evtType, listener[, options]);
options:
	capture: A Boolean that indicates that events of this type will be dispatched to the registered listener before being dispatched to any EventTarget beneath it in the DOM tree.  
	
	once: A Boolean indicating that the listener should be invoked at most once after being added. If it is true, the listener would be removed automatically when it is invoked.
	
	passive: A Boolean indicating that the listener will never call preventDefault(). If it does, the user 	agent should ignore it and generate a console warning.

addEventListener(evtType, listener[, useCapture]);
useCapture:


2. 
addEventListener can take an object as a second argument in which a method called 'handleEvent' is searched and called! No need for binding “this”


If the 'listener' is with 'bind()', it cannot be removed later. 
However, it can be done by using 'handleEvent'
